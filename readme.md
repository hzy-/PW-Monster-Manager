#Persona: Wildcard | Monster Manager

A simple webapp for the game persona woildcard that will allow users to manage their monsters. The webapp will feature both 'official' monsters generated by the games creator and user generated monsters.

The plan is to use Pystache for the frontend, python/bottle for the backend and MongoDB for the database. monsters will be accessed via a RESTful URL structure.
